           KCOLG IDOR SCANNER - OPERATOR'S MANUAL
           "The Marvel of Modern Cyber-Security!"
============================================================

CONGRATULATIONS, PAL! You are now the proud owner of the 
KCOLG Scanner. Follow these swell instructions for success:

1. THE BASE URL (The Secret Address):
   Always provide the full path to the machinery's endpoint.
   SWELL:  https://api.example.com/posts/
   LAME:   https://api.example.com

2. START & END IDs (The Frequency Dial):
   Use whole numbers, just like a telephone dial. The scanner 
   will inspect every unit between your start and finish.
   Ex: Start 1, End 10 (Inspects 10 items for the Boss).

3. THE BEARER TOKEN (The Secret Handshake):
   If the establishment requires a membership, paste your 
   Token here (No need to type 'Bearer', our machine does it!).
   If it's a public joint, just leave it blank and hit Enter.

4. READING THE SIGNALS:
   [!] CRIMSON (RED): Possible IDOR! Data is leaking like 
       a broken pipe! Inspect at once.
   [+] EMERALD (GREEN): The system is ship-shape and secure.
   [-] GREY/WHITE: 404 - Nowhere to be found, mister! 
       Double-check that URL.

GOLDEN ADVICE:
Always test first with IDs you already own to ensure your 
machine is calibrated correctly.

OPERATE WITH CARE. Don't let the G-Men catch you!
